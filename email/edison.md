# [Edison Mail](https://www.edison.tech) ★★


- pretty configurable
- has menubar icon, but cannot remove the dock icon and run in bg
- has dark mode, but it’s not very clear & legible
- some things are too big, some are too small
- threaded view is mashed together so difficult to see where 1 mail ends and another starts
- does not integrate with FM snooze (probably has it’s own stuff)
