# [Spark](https://sparkmailapp.com) ★★★★


- Nice UI, good UX, excellent accessibility
- Pretty dark theme
- Command palette
- Apart from that - utter bullshit! Colors over functionality, limited settings, limited features (can’t pin the sidebar unless I resize the window), long animations.
- No menubar icon, no work in background
