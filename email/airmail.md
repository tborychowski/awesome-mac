# [Airmail](https://airmailapp.com) ★★★★


- nice looking
- nice dark theme (legible & clear)
- decent threaded view
- configurable
- snooze does not integrate with FM
- some emails remain with white background even in dark mode
- a bit too much whitespace in the sidebar (for labels)
- nice integrations (trello, bear, things, fantastical), although couldn't make them work ;-)
